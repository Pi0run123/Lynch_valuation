st.write("**Rule 1:** Investing is fun and exciting, but dangerous if you don't do any work.")
st.write("**Rule 2:** Your investor's edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It's something you already have.")
st.write("**Rule 3:** Over the past decades, stocks have been dominated by a herd of professional investors. This makes it easier for the amateur investor. You can beat the market by ignoring the herd.")
st.write("**Rule 4:** Behind every stock is a company. Find out what it's doing.")
st.write("**Rule 5:** Often, there is no correlation between the success of a company's operations and the success of its stock over a few months or even a few years. In the long term, there is a 100% correlation between the success of the company and the success of its stock. This disparity is the key to making money; it pays to be patient and to own successful companies.")
st.write("**Rule 6:** You have to know what you own, and why you own it. 'This baby is a cinch to go up!' doesn't count.")
st.write("**Rule 7:** Long shots almost always miss the mark.")
st.write("**Rule 8:** Owning stocks is like having childrenâ€”don't get involved with more than you can handle.")
st.write("**Rule 9:** When the insiders are buying, it's a good sign.")
st.write("**Rule 10:** When the insiders are selling, it's a bad sign.")
st.write("**Rule 11:** A surefire sign of a successful stock is that it is not being talked about on the Internet.")
st.write("**Rule 12:** The time to sell is the time to buy.")
st.write("**Rule 13:** When the company buys back its own shares, it's a good sign.")
st.write("**Rule 14:** Companies with low debt are better than companies with high debt.")
st.write("**Rule 15:** Management is more important than the stock price.")
st.write("**Rule 16:** Companies with high profit margins are better than companies with low profit margins.")
